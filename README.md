The files should be run in the following order:

Important: Install the environment.yml, and not any other .yml file that may exist.



0. Install the environment.yml
1. run the file 'run4.py'.
	- make sure to set the ISO_name to either 'MISO' or 'SWPP' in lines 27-28
2. run the file 'example_multi_output_regressor_2.py'
3. run the file 'present_results_2.py'.
	- this creates a html file. Open it if interested to see the generators and gas hubs on the map (opening it is not necessary)
